    This pig script will return some basic information about a MongoDB collection.  Output is:

    1. Field Name.  Embedded fields have their parent's field name prepended to their name.
            Every field that appears in any document in the collection is listed.
    2. Unique value count.  The number of unique values associated with the field.
    3. Example value.  An example value for the field.
    4. Example value type.  The data type of the example value.
    5. Value count.  The number of times the example value appeared for this field in the collection

    Each field is listed up to five times with their five most common example values.
